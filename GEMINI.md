### Refactoring: OwnerCompany to Tenant

**Objective:** To refactor the `OwnerCompany` entity to `Tenant` to improve clarity, consistency, and align with standard multi-tenancy terminology.

**Changes Implemented:**

1.  **Renaming of Files and Classes:**
    *   `app/Models/OwnerCompany.php` renamed to `app/Models/Tenant.php`
    *   `database/factories/OwnerCompanyFactory.php` renamed to `database/factories/TenantFactory.php`
    *   `database/migrations/2025_07_15_211412_create_owner_companies_table.php` renamed to `database/migrations/2025_07_15_211412_create_tenants_table.php`
    *   `database/seeders/OwnerCompanySeeder.php` removed and replaced by `database/seeders/TenantSeeder.php`

2.  **Model Associations with `Tenant`:**
    *   A `tenant_id` foreign key was added to all relevant models (e.g., `Account`, `Bill`, `Contact`, `CrmUser`, `Customer`, `Invoice`, `JournalEntry`, `JournalEntryLine`, `Lead`, `Opportunity`, `Order`, `Payment`, `Product`, `PurchaseOrder`, `Quotation`, `Supplier`, `Transaction`, `Warehouse`).
    *   A `belongsTo` relationship to the `Tenant` model was defined in each of these models to establish the association.

3.  **Scope Coverage Mechanisms:**
    *   The `tenant_id` foreign key serves as the foundation for data isolation, ensuring that records are explicitly linked to a specific tenant.
    *   This structure enables easy implementation of global scopes or explicit `where('tenant_id', $currentTenantId)` clauses for data filtering, ensuring users only access their relevant data.

4.  **Business Logic Updates:**
    *   **Factory Definitions:** All relevant factories were updated to include `tenant_id` and utilize `Tenant::factory()` for creating associated tenant records.
    *   **Migration Updates:** Existing migration files were directly modified to include the `tenant_id` column and its foreign key constraint, avoiding the creation of new migrations for this refactoring. A duplicate `tenant_id` foreign key in `database/migrations/2025_07_06_224649_create_purchase_orders_table.php` was also corrected.
    *   **Seeder Updates:** The `DatabaseSeeder` was updated to call the new `TenantSeeder` to ensure proper data seeding with tenant associations.

This refactoring provides a more robust and semantically correct foundation for multi-tenancy within the application.
